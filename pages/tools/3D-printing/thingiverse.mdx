# Thingiverse

[Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com) is a repository of downloadable 3D models.

Thingiverse is a website dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files. It allows anyone to search for something, like an object or a part, and download models to then edit or print directly. 

Navigating and downloading from the site is simple, and does not require an account.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Take care when downloading and using models, especially for commercial purposes. While all models are available to freely download, some authors have set non-commercial Creative Commons licenses on their models prohibiting them from being used commercially. Check the model page carefully before proceeding.

This is the homepage of [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com). It's recommended that you use an [adblocker](https://ublockorigin.com/) when using Thingiverse, as some ads can be a bit intrusive when trying to navigate. However, it will still work fine without one.

Next, search for something that you want to download/print.
