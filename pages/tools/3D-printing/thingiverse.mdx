# Thingiverse

[Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com) is a repository of downloadable 3D models.

Thingiverse is a website dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files. It allows anyone to search for something, like an object or a part, and download models to then edit or print directly.

Navigating and downloading from the site is simple, and does not require an account.

This is the homepage of [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com). It's recommended that you use an [adblocker](https://ublockorigin.com/) when using Thingiverse, as some ads can be a bit intrusive when trying to navigate. However, it will still work fine without one.

Next, search for something that you want to download/print.
