For scanning anything large or small, Polycam uses the existing cameras in your iPhone to create stitched 3D scans. Using the photo mode, it joins together multiple photos of a single object to create a 3D model, whereas for LiDAR mode it uses the depth sensor to create a mesh map and generate a detailed model in real-time.

While it is a paid app, Polycam can be one of the fastest and most effective ways of scanning full figures/people. For scanning objects, other alternatives exist such as Te WƒÅhi's own 3D 01 scanner and CR Studio.

## Supported filetypes

All scans will export as either .OBJ (shows colours and materials of model), or .STL (no colours, but better compatibility for 3D printing)

## Minimum system requirements

iPhone running iOS 14 or later. For full LiDAR scanning, a Pro or Max variant iPhone is required.
