Te Wāhi has a dedicated 3D scanner that can be used to scan anything from small objects to entire people. The CR Studio app is used to control the scanner and process all scans to create a 3D model.

The 3D01 scanner works best on small to medium sized objects. It is possible to use the electronic turntable in the space to slowly rotate the object as you are scanning. For anything like a human body, using an app such as [Polycam](https://poly.cam) is recommended instead.

## Supported filetypes

All scans will export as either .OBJ (shows colours and materials of model), or .STL (no colours, but better compatibility for 3D printing)

## Minimum system requirements

At least 4GB of RAM. At least 1GB of available hard-disk space. Intel HD or similar graphics card with at least 512 MB video memory
