Autodesk Fusion 360 is a cloud-based CAD/CAM tool for collaborative product development. Fusion 360 enables exploration and iteration on product ideas and collaboration within distributed product development team. Fusion 360 combines organic shapes modelling, mechanical design and manufacturing in one comprehensive package.

Unlike something like Meshmixer or SketchUp, Fusion is more oriented towards the design of products and parts, where the dimensions/measurements are crucial.

There is a bit of a learning curve, but Fusion remains to be one of the most accessible and powerful CAD programs available today.
