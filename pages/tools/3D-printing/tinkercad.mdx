TinkerCad is a great launching point for people of all ages to get into 3D design. Even though it is a simpler CAD program, it is very powerful because it makes it quite simple to make functional parts. By grouping shapes and cutting holes, you can make fairly complex shapes that measure out to the millimeter.
