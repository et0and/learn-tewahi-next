Dotgrid is an open source online vector drawing tool, developed and released by [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co). It allows for the fast and easy creation of glyphs, logos, icons and other designs using a point and grid system.

As it is a web app, it can run on any platform and device with a web browser (although a computer with a keyboard and mouse may be the easiest to use).
