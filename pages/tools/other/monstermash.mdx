MonsterMash is an online sketch-based modelling and animation tool that allows you to quickly sketch a character, inflate it into 3D, and promptly animate it. Developed by Google, the tool allows for quick and easy 3D character modelling through simple shapes and drawing. 

It allows for the exporting of models as STL or GLB files, which can be later edited or printed.
