# gARden

[gARden](https://ar.tewahi.com/) is an online augmented reality (AR) publishing tool.

Drag and drop a 3D model file in GLB format onto gARden, where it will upload your file and generate a unique AR model viewer page on our servers with an associated QR code.

Feel free to save and print the QR code. You can now scan this using the camera on your phone, where you will be able to load the model in AR view (iOS and Android both supported).
