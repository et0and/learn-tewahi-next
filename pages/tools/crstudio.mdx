CR Studio uses the compute power of your computer to process scans. This means that the more powerful your computer, the faster the process will be and vice-versa. The app is only available on Windows and Mac computers.

Te Wāhi has a dedicated 3D scanner that can be used to scan anything from small objects to entire people. The CR Studio app is used to control the scanner and process all scans to create a 3D model.

The 3D01 scanner works best on small to medium sized objects. It is possible to use the electronic turntable in the space to slowly rotate the object as you are scanning. For anything like a human body, using an app such as [Polycam](https://poly.cam) is recommended instead.
