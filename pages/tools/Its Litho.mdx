# ItsLitho

[ItsLitho](http://tool.itslitho.com/) is an online lithophane generator, similar to [3DP Rocks](https://learn.tewahi.com/tools/3dprocks) but with more advanced features.

Using this tool, anyone can convert 2D images into 3D lithophane reliefs that can then be printed.

The basics are simple to understand, and does not require an account.

Images that have strong shadows and contrast tend to work the best with creating lithophanes. You can edit your images in ItsLitho, but it may be better to do this in another program beforehand like Photoshop or Photopea.

There are many options and changes you can make here like changing the size, thickness, and shape of your lithophane. Try changing the shape using the dropdown option into something like a sphere.

Each shape will have its own set of options and settings. Work your way through all the different options until you end up with something that you are happy with.

This file can now be 3D printed using a tool like [Cura](https://learn.tewahi.com/tools/cura), or edited and extended further using something like [Meshmixer](https://learn.tewahi.com/tools/meshmixer).
