![Example of a digital kaitiaki](https://media.tewahi.com/digikaitiaki.png)

For this unit we are going to create our own digital kaitiaki creature, using a combination of [Stable Diffusion](https://learn.tewahi.com/tools/stable-diffusion) and [ZBrush](https://learn.tewahi.com/tools/zbrush).

We will finish by 3D printing these kaitiaki, painting them and presenting them for review.

We will be learning about what different gods/atua in te ao MƒÅori, look at examples of other sculptural representations of gods in other cultures, then use a combination of digital and physical media to design our very own creature.
